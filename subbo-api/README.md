## Development
To build and preview using Miniflare, use
```
npm run miniflare
```

To serve using Miniflare, watch changes and build as you make changes, use 
```
npm run watch
```

To make a production build use
```
npm run build
```

### Testing

The tests are run using Jest. Use `npm test` to run your tests.

This is the recommended way to develop most of your app. Write tests for core functionality instead of relying on Miniflare or `wrangler dev`.

### Publishing
To publish, first make a build using `npm run build` and then use the Wrangler CLI tool.
